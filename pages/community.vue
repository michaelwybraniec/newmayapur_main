          New Mayapur, beyond being a temple, is a village comprising people
          from all walks of life. Our domain is a large property that
          accommodates bhakti-yoga practitioners, volunteers and visitors alike.
          Our goal is to provide everyone with the means to live a fulfilling
          life, through access to material as well as spiritual education, along
          with practical application of a natural, holistic lifestyle.

            New Mayapur is unique, as our community is made of people from
            several generations. From toddlers to seniors, we are learning
            everyday to live and thrive together, by communicating openly and
            honouring our differences. In a modern world where relationships are
            often fractured between age groups, being able to share loving
            exchanges amongst each other is a rare and precious gift.
