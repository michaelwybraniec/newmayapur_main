          New Mayapur runs an ecological, non-violent farm on its domain. Its
          goal is to provide viable solutions for tomorrowâ€™s challenges, by
          empowering individuals with theoretical and practical knowledge
          pertaining to agriculture and animal husbandry, and by showing a
          living exemple of what self-sufficiency could be, per Srila
          Prabhupada's desire.

            We have set three goals for our farm: the steady production of
            grains and dairy, along with fruits and vegetables. Those are the
            essential items needed for a community to provide for its own
            maintenance, related to its food consumption.

            Cow protection is an essential part of <i>vaisnava</i> culture. It
            is said that by caring for the cow, all benefits are bestowed upon
            humanity. The cow is compared to a mother as it is maintaining our
            existence, through its milk and other by-products.

            Beyond a production-driven endeavor, the farm is primarily an
            educational initiative. It is an experiment in living closer to
            nature, in harmony with its cycles and inhabitants. As such, we will
            provide workshops and guided tours in the future.

            Our farm is home to two Jersey cows, who provide us with their milk
            every day, along with their two calves. We also have a herd of four
            billys who help us clean the forest by eating thorn bushes and other
            unwanted vegetation. We take pride in the fact that none of the
            animals we care for will ever see a slaughterhouse, and we therefore
            shelter older bovids who might not be productive anymore, and who
            would have seen their lives terminated in other structures.

            "All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from

            and <i>yajna</i> is born of prescribed duties" (Bhagavad-Gita, 3.14)

            Grains are the staple of a balanced diet. If we are to reach full
            self-sufficiency, we will have to provide grains daily to all the
            members of our community. We currently have a few fields dedicated
            to the production of wheat and amaranth, with which we are
            manufacturing flour and baking bread throughout the year.

            actively using the wood for a variety of construction work, as well
            as heating during the winter season, and make sure the forest stays
            clean and healthy in order to have a reliable, long-term source of

            French gardens are known all over the world for their aesthetics and
            tidyness. New Mayapur is no exception, as we maintain a rose garden
            situtated in front of the castle, that is a beautiful ornament to
            the property and provides us with flowers for the worship of the
            Deities for most of the year.
