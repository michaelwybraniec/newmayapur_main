            In the early 70s, the Hare Krishna devotees in Paris wanted to
            expand as the temple there was too small, especially for families
            and children. After looking at a number of places, they finally
            selected Château d’Oublaise, and the devotees had Srila Prabhupada
            visit here for his advice and support. Srila Prabhupada felt that
            this place would be ideal for the devotees and it was purchased in
            1974.

            The main feature of the property is its castle, which was built on
            the foundations of an old castle on the same site, from the
            Renaissance era. It was built by and belonged to the same family
            (the Preaux dynasty) until its sale in 1946.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            The castle of Oublaise then went into the hands of a French army
            commander, Jean-François Perrette, who gathered unemployed and sick
            French war veterans here after World War II. Perette decided to sell
            it to the Hare Krishna devotees when he reached the age of 80 in
            1974. To this day, it belongs to the International Society for
            Krishna Consciousness.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            The castle is built in a Neo-Renaissance style, has three floors,
            stunning wood marquetry on each floor, pillars ornamented with
            delicate sculptures, and even its own chapel complete with stained
            glass windows. Its opulence and refinement make it a must-see
            location.

            year. In 1975, Srila Prabhupada installed Krishna-Balarama Deities,
            and in 1979, under Bhagavan Dasa, Sri-Sri-Radha-Govinda-Madhava were

            Srila Prabhupada loved New Mayapur, especially for its rural aspect

            the importance of agriculture and cow protection — asking his
            disciples to organise a self-sufficient community depending on
            natural technologies.

        <p class="pt-3 text-lg">
          In New Mayapur, you will find people practicing what is called
          <i>bhakti-yoga</i>, a timeless tradition rooted in the ancient Vedic
          scriptures such as the Bhagavad-gita, the Upanishads and the Puranas.
          Bhakti-yoga, through the agency of meditation, wisdom, culture and
          grace, enables us to transform ourselves and our lives. Bhakti refers
          to the expression of the true self, atma, the soul, manifested through
          serving with love. In Sanskrit, yoga means “to connect”. Bhakti-yoga
          is, therefore, a spiritual path meant to reconnect us and awaken our
          love for the Supreme, Whom we call Krsna.

            Srila Prabhupada was born Abhay Charan De on 1st September, 1896 in
            India. He met his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati,
            in 1922. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was a leader in the Gaudiya Vaishnava
            tradition. He requested Abhay to share the teachings of Lord Krishna
            to the English-speaking world. Abhay became a disciple of Srila
            Bhaktisiddhanta in 1933, and resolved to fulfil his master’s desire.
            Abhay, later known by the honorific title A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
            Prabhupada, spent the next 32 years preparing for his journey west.

            In 1965, at the age of sixty-nine, Srila Prabhupada travelled to New
            York City. He arrived in the United States with his translations of
            sacred Sanskrit texts. Srila Prabhupada began to share the timeless
            wisdom of Krishna consciousness. His message resonated with many
            young people, some of whom became his serious students. With their
            help, Srila Prabhupada rented a small storefront on New York’s Lower
            East Side to use as a temple. On 11th July, 1966, he officially
            registered his organization in the state of New York, founding the
            International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).

          <p class="mt-2">
            In the eleven years that followed, Srila Prabhupada circled the

            Krishna to thousands of people. Men and women from all backgrounds
            accepted his message, and with their help, Srila Prabhupada
            established ISKCON centres and projects throughout the world. Under
            his inspiration, Krishna devotees established temples, rural
            communities and educational institutions.
